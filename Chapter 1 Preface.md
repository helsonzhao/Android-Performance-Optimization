# 1.1 Why This Book was Written
Andoroid Performance optimization is a very important area, and it's importance is reflected in two aspect: Helping applications get greater value and Helping Android Developers enhance their professional competitiveness.
In terms of enhancing the value of a program, performance optimization can enhance the stability of the program, improve user experience such as running speed and smoothness, thereby increaing the Customer Satisfication Score, raising the Rentention Rate, and promoting bussiness growth. For medium and large companies, each program will have a performance quality team responsible for performance optimization and enhancing the value of program.
For Android Developer, proficiency in performance optimization can enhance our competitiveness and bring us better performance in the workplace. In daily work, business requirements rarely reflect the gap in individual technical. However, if we can bring more value to the bussiness through out performance optimization skills beyond the development of bussiness requirements, we will naturally gain more recognation.In interviews, performance optimization is also a topic that is bound to be tested. It's a mainfestation of a developer's technical strength. For developers who are good at performance optimization, they can also stand out in interviews and increate their success rate of interviews.
The importance of performance optimization is self-evident. Therefore, there are many articles on performance optimization on the Internet, and there are also quite a few books on performance optimization cases. After reading these cases, we only know what to do in the same scenario. But in actual development,the scenarios we faced are diverse and complex, including various business types and devices with different performance levels. Therefore, in many cases, we may not know where to start because we can't find an optimization for the same scenario online. We may also find the optimization effect is poor after referring to other's solutions. Or we may enthusiastically propose an optimization solution but chanllenged and refuted by others, making it impossible to implement.
To do a good job in performance optimzation, simply learning some fragmented optimization solutions form others through blogs and other means is completely insufficient. We need to solidly and systematically master knowledge points from multiple levels such as the haredware layer, system layer, and application layer. Therefore, I wrote this book not just to focus on explaing some specific practical cases of performance optimization, but to delve into the knowledge system required for performance optimization, and strive to build a methodology for performance optimization based on this knowledge system and experience case, helping reader achieve thorough understanding, and truly master performance optimization.
